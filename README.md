# Vue Account Manager (demo)

This repository is a minimal Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia demo implementing the account management form described in the task. It includes:

- Add / remove accounts
- Validation on blur / change
- Labels parsing into array of `{ text }`
- Persistence via `localStorage`

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes about git history

For the assignment result we need a repository with commits. Suggested commit steps:

1. `git init` + initial commit with project scaffold
2. Add Pinia store and commit
3. Add AccountRow component and commit
4. Add AccountsList and App and styles and commit
5. Final polish and README commit

This will produce a clear commit history that demonstrates incremental work.


## Usage Instructions
Run npm install && npm run dev
